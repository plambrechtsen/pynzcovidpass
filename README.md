# NZ COVID Pass

Quick and dirty python code using the python-cwt library to validate the NZ COVID Pass QR Code decoded value using the examples Ministry of Health Provided.

The Production Key is different from the examples they supplied so when you want to test the real thing you will need to use the correct key

## Running

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 nzcovidpasscheck.py
```
